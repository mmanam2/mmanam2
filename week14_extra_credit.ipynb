        "1. Prepare the Datasets\n",
        "Inspect the Data: Look at the columns, data types, and structures of both datasets to ensure compatibility.\n",
        "Clean the Data: Remove duplicates, handle missing values, and standardize column names and data formats.\n",
        "Ensure Key Consistency: The key(s) used for merging (e.g., ID, Age, Patient_ID) should be present and consistent in both datasets.\n",
        "2. Identify the Type of Merge\n",
        "Inner Join: Keeps only rows that have matching keys in both datasets.\n",
        "Outer Join:\n",
        "Full Outer Join: Keeps all rows from both datasets, filling in missing data with NaN or a placeholder.\n",
